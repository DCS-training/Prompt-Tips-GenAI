# Some specific notes

From the source numbered as 3;

Be Mindful of Token Limits: "Prompt size is limited by the number of tokens the model can handle. 
Tokens represent individual units of text. Use space efficiently by considering factors like table 
formatting for data inclusion and optimizing whitespace usage. 
For example, The Azure OpenAI text-davinci-003 model has a limit of 4097 tokens of 
combined input and output. Given that we want around 250 words of output and a token 
represents about one-half of a word, we will reserve 500 tokens for the completion response. 
That leaves ~3500 tokens for input, or about 1700 words." Potentially changing and not up to date!

Understand the Different APIs: Depending on the model you're using, such as GPT-35-Turbo or GPT-4, 
you'll need to format your input differently for the Chat Completion API or the Completion API. 
Familiarize yourself with the specific requirements of each API to ensure proper prompt design.
